AudioDash enables users to train their reaction time for multiple sports and athletic activities. Customizable sounds under critical control are played at set intervals in a 3D space around the user's head. The user must follow the auditory cues by running in the direction of the sound. This allows them to improve their reaction time and complete actions that are necessary for success in sports.
